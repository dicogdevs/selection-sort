# Selection Sort

This is a simple Python project to demonstrate the implementation of a selection sort.

## How to use

Import the `selection_sort` function from the `selection_sort` package, and use it as follows:

```python
from selection_sort.selection_sort import selection_sort

array = [64, 25, 12, 22, 11]
sorted_array = selection_sort(array)
print(sorted_array)
